Some Chnages Done in Config File :

and Steps to run:


## Installation

First, with python and pip installed, install the scripts requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you must compile the Protobuf libraries:

```bash
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
```

Add `models` and `models/slim` to your `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
```

>_**Note:** This must be ran every time you open terminal, or added to your `~/.bashrc` file._


## Usage
### 1) Create the TensorFlow Records
Run the script:

```bash
python object_detection/create_tf_record.py
```

Once the script finishes running, you will end up with a `train.record` and a `val.record` file. This is what we will use to train the model.

### 2) Base Model Is available

### 3) Train the Model
Run the following script to train the model:

```bash
python object_detection/train.py \
        --logtostderr \
        --train_dir=train \
        --pipeline_config_path=faster_rcnn_resnet101.config
```

### 4) Export the Inference Graph
The training time is dependent on the amount of training data. My model was pretty solid at ~4.5k steps. The loss reached a minimum at ~20k steps. I let it train for 200k steps, but there wasn't much improvement.

>_**Note:** If training takes way to long, [read this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/tracking-the-millenium-falcon-with-tensorflow-c8c86419225e)._

I recommend testing your model every ~5k steps to make sure youâ€™re on the right path.

You can find checkpoints for your model in `Custom-Object-Detection/train`.

Move the model.ckpt files with the highest number to the root of the repo:
- `model.ckpt-STEP_NUMBER.data-00000-of-00001`
- `model.ckpt-STEP_NUMBER.index`
- `model.ckpt-STEP_NUMBER.meta`

In order to use the model, you first need to convert the checkpoint files (`model.ckpt-STEP_NUMBER.*`) into a frozen inference graph by running this command:

```bash
python object_detection/export_inference_graph.py \
        --input_type image_tensor \
        --pipeline_config_path faster_rcnn_resnet101.config \
        --trained_checkpoint_prefix model.ckpt-STEP_NUMBER \
        --output_directory output_inference_graph
```

You should see a new `output_inference_graph` directory with a `frozen_inference_graph.pb` file.

### 5) Test the Model
Just run the following command:

```bash
python object_detection/object_detection_runner.py
```

It will run your object detection model found at `output_inference_graph/frozen_inference_graph.pb` on all the images in the `test_images` directory and output the results in the `output/test_images` directory.
